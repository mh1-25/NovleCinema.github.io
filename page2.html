          <h3>Film synopsis</h3>
          <blockquote>Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) becomes winter caretaker
            at the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado, hoping to cure his
            writer's block. He settles in along with his wife, Wendy (Shelley 
            Duval), and his son, Danny (Danny Lloyd), who is plagued by psychic
            premonitions. As Jack's writing goes nowhere and Danny's visions
            become more disturbing, Jack discovers the hotel's dark secrets and
            begins to unravel into a homicidal maniac hell-bent on terrorizing
            his family.</blockquote>

          <h3>Author's Opinion</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Despite its widespread praise, King famously despised Kubrick's
            adaptation of his book, so much so that he called it “a maddening,
            perverse, and disappointing film,” likening it to “a great big
            beautiful Cadillac with no motor inside,” eventually remaking
            the adaptation himself into a teleplay to finally “correct”

            is the perfect chance for a fresh start. As the off-season
            caretaker at the atmospheric old hotel, he'll have plenty of
            time to spend reconnecting with his family and working on his writing.</blockquote>

          <div id="desc">
          <blockquote>King was born in Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. 
            His father, Donald Edwin King, a traveling vacuum salesman after
            returning from World War II, was born in Indiana with the surname
            Pollock, changing it to King as an adult.[10] King's mother was
            Nellie Ruth King (née Pillsbury). His parents were married
            in Scarborough, Maine, on July 23, 1939. They lived with Donald's
            family in Chicago before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, New York.
            King's parents returned to Maine towards the end of World War II,
            living in a modest house in Scarborough. He is of Scots-Irish descent.
          <span id="hidden">         
               King sold his first
               professional short story,
              "The Glass Floor", to Startling
               Mystery Stories in 1967. After
              graduating from the University
               of Maine, King earned a certificate
              to teach high school but was unable
               to find a teaching post
              immediately. He sold short stories
               to magazines like Cavalier.
              Many of these early stories were
               republished in Night Shift (1978).
