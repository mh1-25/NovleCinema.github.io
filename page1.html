    <blockquote>Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name,
         focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino),
          reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal
          relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.<small><a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=27919f41f8c15d06&sxsrf=ACQVn08R3Twn-jojoh47tmipHUPkRSc24g:1712095412359&q=The+Godfather&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLUz9U3ME83LM5VQjAfMZpwC7z8cU9YSnvSmpPXGFW5uIIz8std80oySyqFxLnYoCxeKW4uhC6eRay8IRmpCu75KWmJJRmpRQCPlNJeXwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjX8_-2xKSFAxV8T6QEHftZCbcQ_coHKAF6BAgPEAg">source</a></small></blockquote>

   <p>Summary</p>
   <blockquote>The Corleone family, one of the Five Families of the New York Mafia, fights the other four families in a brutal war in the years after
     World War II. After Don Vito Corleone is shot by men working for drug kingpin Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, two of Corleone's sons, Santino (Sonny)
      and Michael, must run the family business with the help of consigliere Tom Hagen and the family's two trusted caporegimes, Peter Clemenza and
       Salvatore Tessio. When Michael murders Sollozzo and his bodyguard, corrupt NYPD Captain Mark McCluskey, while meeting with them in a restaurant,
        the conflict escalates into a full-scale war which results in Sonny's murder. Michael must return from hiding in Sicily to assume control of the
        family as the new Don. Under his retired father's tutelage, Michael orchestrates a plan to exact revenge, while relocating the Corleone family's
        power base to Las Vegas in order to further his goal of legitimizing the family and getting them out of organized crime. This encompasses the murder
         of all of the Corleone family's enemies, including Michael's brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi, who played a part in Sonny's murder. After selling all of 
         the family's remaining businesses in New York, the Corleones permanently move to Las Vegas.<small><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_(novel)">source</a></small></blockquote>
   <p>About the Author:Mario Puzo</p>
   <blockquote>Puzo's most famous work, The Godfather, was first published in 1969 after he had heard anecdotes about Mafia organizations during his
     time in pulp journalism. He later said in an interview with Larry King that his principal motivation was to make money. He had already, after all,
      written two books that had received great reviews, yet had not amounted to much. As a government clerk with five children, he was looking to write
       something that would appeal to the masses. With a number one bestseller for months on the New York Times Best Seller List, Mario Puzo had found his
        target audience. The book was later developed into the film The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola. The movie received 11 Academy Award
         nominations, winning three, including an Oscar for Puzo for Best Adapted Screenplay. Coppola and Puzo collaborated then to work on sequels to the
          original film, The Godfather Part II and The Godfather Part III.<small><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22034.The_Godfather">source</a></small></blockquote>
