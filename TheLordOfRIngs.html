                <h1>summary</h1>
                <p>The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.</p>

                                <p>Frodo inherits a ring from his uncle, Bilbo Baggins, but soon learns from the Wizard Gandalf that it is the infamous Ring of Power.
                                    Knowing the Dark Lord Sauron will be searching for it, Frodo embarks on a journey towards the Elven town of Rivendell.
                                     His friend Samwise Gamgee insists on accompanying him. Frodo and Sam are then joined by their friends, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took.
                                      With the help of a man named Strider, they arrive in Rivendell. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir to the throne of Gondor.
                                       Gandalf informs them that the powerful Wizard Saruman has joined Sauron.
               
                                   At Rivendell, the Council of Elrond decides that a group of nine,
                                    dubbed "The Fellowship of the Ring," will set off to destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom, which is deep in Sauron's territory.
                                     Frodo Baggins is to be the ring-bearer and must ultimately destroy the Ring when they arrive. While traveling through the Mines of Moria,
                                      Gandalf falls into an abyss while battling a fire demon known as the Balrog. Without their leader, 
                                      the Fellowship is shaken, and even a brief respite with the Elf Galadriel cannot heal their bond.
                                       Desperate to protect his home nation of Gondor, Boromir tries to steal the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo runs away from the Fellowship.
                                        Sam follows him.</p>

                                <p>As Frodo and Sam leave, a band of orcs captures Merry and Pippin and kills Boromir.
                                    Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli decide to let the Ringbearer go and instead rescue Merry and Pippin.
                                     Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs as they run across the fields of Rohan toward Saruman's fortress at Isengard.
                                      They find evidence that the orcs of Sauron and Saruman have quarreled and that either one hobbit is still alive, 
                                      but they begin to lose hope as they fall farther and farther behind. After three days of running with little rest,
                                       they meet a troop of the riders of Rohan. The horsemen's leader, Éomer, informs the trio that the orcs were destroyed on the edge of Fangorn forest,
                                        with no survivors. He lends them horses to continue the pursuit, but offers little hope that the hobbits escaped the battle.
               
                                   Although treated roughly by the orcs, Merry and Pippin remain unharmed. When the Rohirrim attack, the hobbits run to the safety of the forest. They eventually make their way through the dense woodland to a stony hill where they meet Treebeard the Ent. This ancient being looks like a walking and talking tree and is the guardian of the forest. He does not particularly care about Sauron, but he takes the threat of Saruman very seriously. The wizard once cared for the forest and learned much from Treebeard, but now he chops down the trees to fuel the war machines of Isengard
                                   . Treebeard calls an Entmoot, a meeting of many Ents who decide to fight Saruman.</p>

                                <p>To keep Pippin out of further trouble, Gandalf rides with him to Minas Tirith, the city that Sauron's armies will soon besiege.
                                    They meet with Boromir's father Denethor, the Ruling Steward of Gondor, and in gratitude for Boromir's sacrifice (saving them from the orcs at Parth Galen),
                                     Pippin pledges his service to the steward as a Guard of the White Tower. Denethor does not trust Gandalf,
                                      and he knows that the wizard has brought Aragorn to reclaim the throne. Faramir returns to the city, wearied from fighting, and reports his encounter with Frodo.
                                       Angry that his son did not bring the Ring to Gondor,
                                    Denethor sends the exhausted captain back into the field to lead a rearguard action against the oncoming army.
                                     When they make their last dash for the safety of the gates, Gandalf rides out to defend them from the flying Nazgûl, but Faramir falls at the gates.
               
                                   The Riders of Rohan muster their forces, preparing to ride to the aid of Minas Tirith, 
                                   and Merry strikes up a friendship with Théoden. Aragorn realizes that he must take the Paths of the Dead if he is to reach Minas Tirith in time to lift the siege.
                                    He takes the evil road with Legolas, Gimli,
                                     and the Dúnedain (a group of Rangers) who have joined him from the North, but the Rohirrim are convinced that he has gone to his own death.
                                      Théoden leaves behind Merry and his niece Éowyn, claiming that neither can help in the battle, but a young rider offers to carry Merry.
                                       With the aid of a strange tribesman, the Rohirrim find a forgotten road and arrive just in time to surprise the besieging army at Minas Tirith.</p>
